# Used IPhone Valuation Tool

Problem: Selling a used phone is annoying. It's hard to figure out marketprice. You don't want to overprice it and never have it be sold; nor do you want to price it low and lose out on potential profit for you next awesome phone.

Solution: I webscraped data for recently sold iPhones (Oct 3-6) and trained an ML algorithm to predict a suggested price.

Results: My algorithm predicts with an avereage error of $34, a great baseline!
